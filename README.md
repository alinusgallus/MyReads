# MyReads  App

React project created for the Udacity React Nanodegree
It lists the books in your library and allows you to move books from one shelf to another and search them.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository
2. cd into the project directory
3. run npm install
4. run npm start

### Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

### create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App. You can find more information on how to perform common tasks here.
